# Push Swap

## Summary

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

## Tasks

### Mandatory Part

Rules

  1. You have 2 stacks, named a and b;
  2. At the beginning
      2.1. The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated
       2.2. The stack b is empty.
  3. The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so, you have the following operations at your disposal

| Code | Name | Description |
|:----:| :---:| :----------:|
| `sa` | (swap a) | Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements. |
| `sb` | (swap b) | Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements. |
| `ss` | (swap a and swap b) | Do `sa` and `sb` at the same time. |
| `pa` | (push a) | Take the first element at the top of `b` and put it at the top of `a`. Do nothing if `b` is empty. |
| `pb` | (push b) | Take the first element at the top of `a` and put it at the top of `b`. Do nothing if `a` is empty. |
| `ra` | (rotate a) | Shift up all elements of stack `a` by 1. The first element becomes the last one. |
| `rb` | (rotate b) | Shift up all elements of stack `b` by 1. The first element becomes the last one. |
| `rr` | (rotate a and rotate b) | Do `ra` and `rb` at the same time. |
| `rra` | (reverse rotate a) | Shift down all elements of stack `a` by 1. The last element becomes the first one. |
| `rrb` | (reverse rotate b) | Shift down all elements of stack `b` by 1. The last element becomes the first one. |
| `rrr` | (reverse rotate a and reverse rotate b) | Do `rra` and `rrb` at the same time. |
