Initial phase

	1. parse
	2. create a stack which is a circular double linked list
	3. Addition in the struct of a rank component (1 to n)

Phase 1

	1. Split the list into 3
	2. Push the 2 smallest thirds into stack B, do a pre-sort doing ra
	3. Repeat the operation 1 & 2 until there are only 3 numbers left in A
	4. Sort these 3 numbers with algo

Phase 2

	1. Swap B and look for the number that will take the fewest moves to push into A
		1.1. Each time there are 4 ways to bring a number from B to A
			ra+rb
			ra+rrb
			rra+rb
			rra+rrb
	2. Perform operation
	3. Repeat until empty B
	
Phase 3

	1. If necessary rotate A to finalize: ra or rra
	2. The optimization comes from the fact of the max use of double rotations rr and rrr




Plano

1. Create a circular double linked list
2.
